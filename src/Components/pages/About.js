                From an early age, California native Jahn Dough<br/> <br/>
                found joy and understanding within music. Born Devin Parhms,<br/> <br/>
                Jahn Dough remembers vibing to music of all genres, from both west<br/> <br/>
                and east coast hip hop to jazz and blues. His early hip hop influences include<br/> <br/>
                Spice 1, Xzibit, MC Eiht, DJ Quik, Biggie, and E-40 to name a few. Specifically, Jahn Dough<br/> <br/>
                credits his eclectic taste to the influence of his older brother, Darnell. They would listen to<br/> <br/>
                hip hop from all eras while driving around in the car, windows down – it was then when Jahn Dough began rapping,<br/> <br/>
                memorizing Dr. Dre’s “2001” from top to bottom. In 2007, Jahn Dough moved to Texas. Once there, he began to grow an appreciation through<br/> <br/>
                for southern music in artists like OutKast, 36 Mafia, and UGK. Jahn Dough began experimenting with his own sound in early junior high writing music.<br/> <br/>
                He recorded his first mix tape as a senior in high school. Throughout college, he continued writing and recording, developing and honing<br/> <br/>
                his writing ability and sound. For Jahn Dough, music has always been a way to escape and release from his external<br/> <br/>
                environment. He’s grown a love for the creative process and enjoys the freedom it brings him, both<br/> <br/>
                with writing and experimenting with many different sounds. Jahn Dough’s relatable story- telling<br/> <br/>
                and writing ability has been heavily influenced by artists like Isaiah Rashad,<br/>  <br/>
                Andre 3000, Kendrick Lamar and Spice 1, to name a few. His goal has<br/> <br/>
                always been to be as authentic as possible, and relate to his<br/> <br/>
                audience. Jahn Dough wants to share with his audience<br/> <br/>
                his story and how that has influenced<br/> <br/>
                how he views this world.<br/> <br/>
